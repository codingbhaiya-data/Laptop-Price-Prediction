# Laptop-Price-Prediction 
Aim of the Project:
To develop a predictive model for laptop pricing using machine learning, leveraging key features like brand, specifications, and system configurations to estimate accurate price ranges.

Tools Used:

Python (for data preprocessing and model development)
Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation and analysis)
Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation and documentation)
Outcome & Impact of Project:

Built a laptop price prediction model based on various features like company, type, RAM, screen resolution, CPU, storage, and GPU.
The model accurately predicted the price of a Samsung Notebook with Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and a 15.6” IPS screen at ₹69,089.
Helped in understanding the impact of different specifications on laptop pricing, allowing for better price estimation and decision-making for buyers and retailers.
Improved accuracy in predicting price variations across different brands and configurations, making it useful for e-commerce platforms and tech enthusiasts.
Personal Learnings:

Gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model building.
Improved understanding of how different laptop specifications affect pricing.
Learned to evaluate models using performance metrics and feature importance analysis.
Developed skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques for understanding trends in laptop prices.
